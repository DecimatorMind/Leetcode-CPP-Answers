# Leetcode-CPP-Answers
My solutions for LeetCode questions in CPP

This repository contains the solutions for LeetCode Questions, The language of choice is CPP ( C++ ).

# How to test
The CPP files, contains variables initialised in the following format.
 
    int i {};

To initialise the variable enter the value in the {} like:

    int i {1};

and run the file.


# How to use
Before running the project, please change the name of the function to the "main".

Since in LeetCode, there are in function questions therefore in order to use the solution one has to keep only required statements.

Delete the function argument variables as they are already declared in the leetcode code function.

Also the print statements need to be replaced by the return statement.
